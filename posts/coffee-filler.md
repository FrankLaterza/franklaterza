# Overview

As a coffee lover, I know how frustrating it is to refill the Keurig machine every time I want a cup of coffee. That's why I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a machine that never needs refilling again. In this blog post, I'll share with you the design, materials, and process I used to create this innovative device.

## Design:

The first step in this project was to design a model that could fit on the Keurig machine without any configuration. Using Solidworks, I was able to create a model that works perfectly with the Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker. The best part? You can download the STL files and print it yourself! All the parts can be found on Amazon, making this project easy and accessible for anyone.

## Pump

For this project, I used a peristaltic pump, which is mainly used for precise measurements. While this type of pump is slow, it was the best option I had on hand. However, I'm currently working on a redesign to make the machine faster and more efficient.

## Electronics

To power the pump, I used a liquid level sensor to trip a relay. The whole machine runs on 5V, so there's no need to worry about any electrical hazards. The setup is simple and straightforward, making it easy for anyone to replicate.

## Conclusion

After many hours of designing and testing, I'm happy to say that the machine is complete! With this device, you'll never have to refill your Keurig again. It's perfect for busy mornings or when you have guests over. I hope this project inspires you to create your own innovative solutions and share them with others. Happy brewing!
