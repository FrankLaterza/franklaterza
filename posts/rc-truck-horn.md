## Introduction

At Sparrow Design one, we love creating unique and exciting projects for our clients. Vlog Creations came to use for a project idea. They asked us to put a train horn in a remote-controlled truck. In this blog post, I'll share the design, materials, and process we used to create this one-of-a-kind project. Check out the video here [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYgAf2eu8sQ&t=5m7s)

## Design

The first step in this project was to find a base for the remote-controlled truck. We purchased a truck base on Amazon and used Fusion 360 to design and cut all the necessary parts with a CNC machine. The truck is fastened with metal screws, ensuring that everything is securely in place.

## Horn

For the train horn, we purchased a high-quality horn on Amazon. This horn is loud and powerful, perfect for our project.

## Electronics

The electronics for this project are dead simple. The train horn is controlled with a remote relay, while the truck is controlled with its original remote. We also added two cameras to the truck: a 4k Runcam for video footage and an FPV cam for a real-time feed of the truck. With these cameras, you can see everything that's happening with the truck in real-time.
