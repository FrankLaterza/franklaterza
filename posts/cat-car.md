### Idea:

Put a cat on a remote-controlled truck.

### Truck:

The base of the RC truck was purchased on amazon. All parts were designed in Fusion 360 and cut with a CNC machine except for the aluminum rods. Everything was fastened with metal screws.

### Electronics:

The electronics are a little more complex then the rc-train-horn project. The cat has loud speakers and a servo that moves the head that are both triggered by a remote relay module. An Arduino Pro-Micro gets the signals from the relay and controls the servo angle and the Adafruit audio trigger. There is also a mount for a 4k camera and a live feed camera.
